# My Digital Journey

Welcome. This repository powers *My Digital Journey* — a space where I share journaling tools, creative prompts, and other digital resources designed to support reflection and intentional living.

Whether you're building a journaling habit or exploring new ways to connect with yourself, this site is here to support your process.

## About This Project

This project is part of my journey into coding, creativity, and conscious digital design.

The site includes:
- Journaling prompts and tools  
- Digital resources  
- A growing web app designed to support mindful digital journaling

I'm keeping things lean and intentional by using GitHub Pages for hosting while I learn and build.
